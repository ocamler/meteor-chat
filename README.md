MeteorChat
==========

## ocamler's fork:

The goals here are to add some subtle improvements:

* indicate who's connected, thanks to `mizzao:user-status` \[**DONE**\]
* save history of messages even after restart \[**DONE**\]
* drive room switching by window.location.hash value \[**DONE**\]
* allow users to create new rooms on the fly \[**DONE**\]
* make the app mobile-friendly
* add an admin panel to log, archive, download and purge old posts

## dasniko's original:

Simple chat application with different chat-rooms built on the [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) JavaScript Platform.

Not much functionality, only to demonstrate how _simple_ it is to set up a reactive app using Meteor.

Used add-on packages (for convenience only!):

* `bootstrap` for beautifying the UI
* `accounts-password` and `accounts-ui` for having the user authenticated right out of the box

Application is deployed at <http://chat.n-k.de>

Feel free to fork/copy/whatever...
